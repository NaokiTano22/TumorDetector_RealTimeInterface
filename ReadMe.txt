This program is for the real-time interface of the Balloon-Integrated Pneumatic Tactile Sensor for tumor detection.

The tumor detector connected to the four balloons and obtain the pressure from the four pressure sensors.
Then, the program will probide the color map based on the values of the pressure sensors.

TumorDetect_Interface.m: main program of the interface.
Arduino file: Arduino Uno setting to obtain the four pressure values.
